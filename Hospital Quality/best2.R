#Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an
#outcome name. The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv and returns a character vector
#with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specifed outcome
#in that state. The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can
#be one of heart attack, heart failure, or pneumonia. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular
#outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
